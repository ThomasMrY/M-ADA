# Learning to Learn Single Domain Generalization (CVPR 2020)

This repository holds the Pytorch implementation of [Learning to Learn Single Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13216) by Fengchun Qiao, Long Zhao and Xi Peng. 

## Introduction

We are concerned with a worst-case scenario in model generalization, in the sense that a model aims to perform well on many unseen domains while there is only one single domain available for training. We propose a new method named adversarial domain augmentation to solve this Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. The key idea is to leverage adversarial training to create “fictitious” yet “challenging” populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees.

## Prerequisites

This package has the following requirements:

* `Python 3.6`
* `Pytorch 1.1.0`
* `MetaNN 0.1.5`
* `Scipy 1.2.1`

## Training from scratch

Download and process [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/):

```
cd utils
python download_and_process_mnist.py
```

Run the following command:

```
python main_Digits.py
```

## Evaluating our pretrained models

The pretrained models can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19VGuIsv38JutNCkKrG3htBBau3gomhYC). Put `checkpoint` in the project root directory.

To evaluate on [Digits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12018), run:

```
mkdir ./data/svhn
wget http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test_32x32.mat -O "./data/svhn/test_32x32.mat"  # download the test set of SVHN
python main_Digits.py --mode test --resume checkpoint/pretrained/ckpt_mnist.pth.tar
```
